# Fastfood Ordering and Management System

## Introduction

This is a project for SC2002 (Object Oriented Programming). The fast food ordering and management system is designed to include the functions of ordering, payment, and order management for both customers and staff in fast food restaurants. It enables efficient staff management, easy menu browsing, order customization, and payment processing.

This project is done using Java programming language and applies the design principles of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Actors
1. Customers
   - Can browse the menu, customise orders, make payments, and track order status, collect food after the order status becomes "ready to pickup"
2. Staff
   - Process order
3. Manager
   - Process order
   - Manages menu items
4. Admin
   - Responsible for company management and staff management

## Additional Requirements
- For Staff, Manger and Admin, the default password for first login is 'default', which then requires user to change it after
- Orders are automatically cancelled and removed from the "ready to pickup" list if not picked up within a specific timeframe (set to 60s)
- Manpower requirements for each branch
  - A branch with 1-4 staff has 1 manager
  - A branch with 5-8 staff has 2 managers
  - A branch with 9-15 staff has 3 managers
